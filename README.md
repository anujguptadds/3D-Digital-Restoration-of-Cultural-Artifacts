# 3D-Digital-Restoration-of-Cultural-Artifacts

### Motivation
*Analyzing the topography of artifacts and monuments physically has always been a challenging task due to various difficulties such as large sizes and complex structures
*Reconstructing a 3D digital model on a computer will be beneficial 
*Analysis using software medium would result in faster and more accurate results
*We use Fringe Projection Profilometry (FPP) for this purpose
